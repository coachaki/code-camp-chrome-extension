# Challenge 11

Working off of Challenge 10 Task 2, let's create an extension that interacts with Omni CMS.

## Part 1: Context Menu Item for "Published Page"

Add a context menu item that links you to the published page when you right click on a staging file.

Things to think about:

- How do you get the publish domain?
- How do you get the publish extension?
- Which links does it work on? (e.g., folder, pcf, inc, js, png, jpg)

## Part 2: Expand to support multiple publish outputs

If you didn't already allow for multiple publish outputs, then add the functionality here. How do you get them all?
