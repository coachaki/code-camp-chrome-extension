# Challenge 11

Working off of Challenge 10 Task 2, let's create an extension that interacts with Omni CMS.

1. Add a context menu item that links you to the published page when you right click on a staging file.

Things to think about:

- How do you get the publish domain?
- How do you get the publish extension?
- What if it has multiple outputs? Link to the first or links for all?
