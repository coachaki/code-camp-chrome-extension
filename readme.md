Chrome recently upgraded their manifest version to v3, and we will be working through the v3 extension.

## Challenge 10

2. Add a context menu item that does the same thing as the button on the popup.html page.
    - perform `git checkout ch10-2` to pull the code containing tasks 1 and 2
3. Add the same button to the devtools panel.

## Challenge 11
