# Challenge 13

In Challenge 11, we used the context menu UX for Web Extensions, which is effective for simple actions.

In Challenge 12, added implemented some component actions for the popup UX. While it was a simple way to create a UX, the popup UX wasn't the ideal UX for not-so-commonly used actions like what we did in challenge 12.

In Challenge 13, we're going to move what we did for the popup UX into the devtools panel.

## The Challenge

1. Move the component actions we worked on in Challenge 12 from the Popup UX to the Devtools UX. Feel free to add functionalities as well.
2. Bonus: If you have an idea for something to go in the popup UX, then feel free to implement it (or start).

## Components List and Bulk Actions

1. In the popup window, list components and additional properties that might be useful.
2. Add checkboxes and a way to perform bulk actions.
3. These actions can be anything. One or more you can come up with.
