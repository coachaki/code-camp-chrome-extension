# Challenge 12

In Challenge 11, we used the context menu UX for Web Extensions, which is effective for simple actions.

In Challenge 12, we'll take advantage of the popup UX for performing more complex actions.

## Components List and Bulk Actions

1. In the popup window, list components and additional properties that might be useful.
2. Add checkboxes and a way to perform bulk actions.
3. These actions can be anything. One or more you can come up with.
